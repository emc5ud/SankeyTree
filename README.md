This is a Machine learning and visualization project that determines the legitimacy of German bank notes.

This project was inspired by the [sankey diagram](http://blockbuilder.org/mbostock/ca9a0bb7ba204d12974bca90acc507c0) and based on the collapsible tree code from [Mike Stockton's block](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083). 

### Dataset and Tree Construction

The dataset for this project was found on [CI's Machine Learning Respository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication). Per UCI's description:
